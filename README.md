Description: The main story is about a child that lives in a small town, his friends are disappearing and you start to investigate what is going on. Meanwhile there is a second character that is an elder man that will also have some tasks to complete. As the story progresses, it becomes more.. crazier,  and the player starts to find out the connections between the two characters. In order to progress, you will need to complete quests that involves resolving puzzles, combats and stealth. The gameplay will be as simple as possible, first-person perspective, lowpoly scenes, and we could use turn based combat.
